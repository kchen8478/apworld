## Haitian Revolution (1791–1804)

### Causes
- **Harsh slavery system**: Enslaved Africans made up the majority of the population and were brutally exploited on sugar plantations in the French colony of Saint-Domingue.
- **Social hierarchy**: Rigid class structure (white planters, free people of color, enslaved people) created deep tensions.
- **Enlightenment ideas**: Concepts of liberty and equality inspired enslaved and free Black people to challenge colonial rule.
- **French Revolution (1789)**: Created political instability and raised hopes for rights and emancipation.
- **Declaration of the Rights of Man (1789)**: Inspired free people of color and enslaved individuals to demand rights.

### Key Events
- **1791 slave revolt**: Massive uprising in northern Saint-Domingue led by formerly enslaved leaders.
- **Toussaint Louverture rises**: Formerly enslaved general became the leader of the revolution and a brilliant military strategist.
- **Abolition of slavery (1794)**: French National Convention abolished slavery in the colonies.
- **War with foreign powers**: Britain and Spain attempted to seize control; defeated by Haitian forces.
- **Napoleon sends forces (1802)**: Attempt to restore slavery and French control failed due to resistance and disease.
- **Death of Louverture (1803)**: Captured and deported by the French; died in a French prison.
- **Victory and independence (1804)**: Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared Haiti’s independence—the first Black-led republic and second independent nation in the Western Hemisphere.

### Results
- **Abolition of slavery**: Only successful slave revolt leading to a free state governed by formerly enslaved people.
- **End of French rule in Haiti**: France lost its most profitable colony.
- **Massive casualties**: Hundreds of thousands died, including enslaved people, colonists, and French soldiers.
- **Economic hardship**: France demanded reparations; Haiti was diplomatically isolated and economically punished.

### Significance
- First successful slave revolution in world history.
- Challenged global racial hierarchies and inspired future anti-colonial movements.
- Instilled fear in slaveholding societies across the Americas (e.g., U.S. South, Caribbean).
- Accelerated the decline of European colonial empires in the Americas.
- Set the stage for debates on race, freedom, and sovereignty in the modern era.
