## Mexican Revolution (1910–1920)

### Causes
- **Dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz (1876–1911)**: 35 years of authoritarian rule favored foreign investors and elites, causing land dispossession and widespread poverty among peasants and workers.
- **Land inequality**: Large estates (haciendas) controlled most arable land; indigenous and rural communities were exploited.
- **Political repression**: Lack of political freedoms and exclusion of middle/lower classes from power.
- **Economic instability**: Growing social unrest due to economic disparity and harsh labor conditions.

### Key Events

#### Early Revolution (1910–1913)
- **Francisco I. Madero**: Called for democratic reform and an end to Díaz’s regime (*Plan of San Luis Potosí*).
  - Díaz resigned (1911); Madero became president.
- **Opposition to Madero**: Failed land reforms and growing discontent led to his overthrow and assassination in 1913.

#### Civil War and Shifting Alliances (1913–1917)
- **Victoriano Huerta’s dictatorship (1913–1914)**: Seized power after Madero’s death; opposed by revolutionary leaders.
  - **Venustiano Carranza**, **Pancho Villa**, and **Emiliano Zapata** formed factions against Huerta.
- **Emiliano Zapata**: Fought for land reform and peasant rights (*Plan of Ayala*).
- **Pancho Villa**: Revolutionary leader in northern Mexico, represented armed resistance to elites.
- **Carranza vs. Villa/Zapata**: After Huerta’s fall in 1914, internal conflict persisted between revolutionary factions.

#### Constitutional Phase (1917–1920)
- **Constitution of 1917**: 
  - Introduced land redistribution (Article 27), labor rights (Article 123), and curbed power of the Church.
  - Considered one of the most progressive constitutions of its time.
- Continued fighting between factions until **Carranza** was overthrown in 1920.
- Rise of **Álvaro Obregón**, who stabilized the country and implemented constitutional reforms.

### Results
- **End of long-standing dictatorship**: Broke Porfirio Díaz’s legacy of elite control.
- **Land reforms**: Redistribution of land to peasants (though progress was gradual).
- **Labor rights**: Protection of workers, establishment of unions, improved working conditions.
- **Weakened Church**: Reduced control of the Catholic Church over land and education.
- **Political restructuring**: Foundation of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated Mexican politics for much of the 20th century.

### Significance
- First major social revolution of the 20th century.
- Inspiring model for later revolutionary movements (e.g., Russian Revolution, Cuban Revolution).
- Transformed Mexico’s political, social, and economic landscapes.
- Highlighted themes of agrarian reform, labor rights, and anti-authoritarianism.
