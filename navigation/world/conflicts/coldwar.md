## Causes
- **Ideological conflict**: capitalism/democracy (US and allies) vs. communism/authoritarianism (USSR and allies)
- **Post-WWII tensions**: disagreement on rebuilding Europe, fate of Germany
- **Soviet expansion** in Eastern Europe; installation of communist governments (Poland, Hungary, etc.)
- **Truman Doctrine (1947)**: pledged US support to nations resisting communism (Greece and Turkey)
- **Marshall Plan (1948)**: US economic aid to rebuild Europe, also to curb communism
- **Berlin Blockade (1948-49)**: USSR attempted to cut off West Berlin; US responded with Berlin Airlift
- **NATO formation (1949)**: US-led military alliance
- **Soviet atomic bomb (1949)**: ended US nuclear monopoly, intensified arms race

## Proxy Wars

### Korean War
- 1950–1953: North invaded South
- US-led UN force intervened; China joined North
- Result: stalemate, armistice, Korea divided at 38th parallel

### Vietnam War
- 1955–1975
- US supported South Vietnam to contain communism; North backed by USSR and China
- Costly, unpopular war → US withdrawal
- 1975: fall of Saigon, Vietnam unified under communism

### Afghanistan War
- 1979–1989
- USSR invaded to support communist government
- US provided weapons to mujahideen (including future Taliban/al-Qaeda members)
- USSR withdrew in 1989 → major Cold War embarrassment

### Angolan Civil War
- Post-independence conflict (1975–2002)
- MPLA (Marxist, USSR/Cuba-backed) vs. UNITA (US/South Africa-backed)
- Example of Cold War extending into post-colonial Africa

### Latin America
- **Nicaragua**: US-backed Contras fought Sandinista gov't (socialist)
- **Chile**: 1973 coup ousted Allende (elected socialist); Pinochet ruled with US backing
- US often prioritized anti-communism over democracy in region

## Effects

### Arms Race
- **Hydrogen bomb** developed by both sides (1950s)
- **ICBMs** (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles): enabled global nuclear threat
- **Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)**: closest to nuclear war; USSR placed missiles in Cuba, US blockaded island → peaceful resolution

### Space Race
- **Sputnik (1957)**: first satellite (USSR)
- **NASA founded (1958)** in response
- **Moon landing (1969)**: US lands Apollo 11
- Tech competition symbolic of ideological superiority

### Fall of Soviet Union
- **Glasnost** ("openness") & **Perestroika** ("restructuring") by Gorbachev attempted reforms
- 1989: fall of Berlin Wall, collapse of Eastern Bloc
- 1991: USSR dissolved into 15 independent republics

### NATO and Warsaw Pact
- **NATO** (1949): US, Western Europe defense alliance
- **Warsaw Pact** (1955): Soviet military alliance in Eastern Europe
- Both used to exert control and influence across Europe

### Third World Interventions
- US and USSR backed opposing groups in Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia
- Cold War battles often played out in newly independent countries (decolonization period)
- Support for dictatorships or rebel groups often had long-term destabilizing effects

### Global Tensions and Espionage
- **CIA (US)** vs. **KGB (USSR)**: espionage, spy scandals, disinformation campaigns
- McCarthyism in US: domestic crackdown on suspected communists
- **Nuclear anxiety**: duck-and-cover drills, fallout shelters, civil defense programs

## Other Key Events

### Berlin Wall (1961–1989)
- Built by East Germany to stop migration to capitalist West Berlin
- Became symbol of Cold War division
- Fell in 1989 during Eastern Bloc revolutions

### Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)
- USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba
- US imposed naval blockade
- Tense 13-day standoff, ended with USSR withdrawing missiles and US promising not to invade Cuba

### Detente (1970s)
- Period of eased tensions between US and USSR
- Treaties: SALT I (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks), Helsinki Accords
- Ended with Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

### Non-Aligned Movement
- Led by nations like India, Yugoslavia, Egypt
- Rejected alignment with either US or USSR
- Aimed to remain independent and promote global South solidarity

### Cultural and Sports Rivalries
- Olympic boycotts: US (1980 Moscow Games), USSR (1984 LA Games)
- Propaganda wars: movies, art, education used to promote ideology

### Legacy
- Continued US global dominance after USSR collapse
- Former Soviet states struggle with political/economic transition
- Ongoing nuclear tensions, especially with Russia and other powers
