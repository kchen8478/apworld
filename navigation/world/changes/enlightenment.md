- **French Revolution**: Enlightenment principles were a catalyst for challenging absolute monarchy and the aristocracy, leading to the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the French Republic.
- **Constitutional Monarchies**: Enlightenment ideas contributed to the gradual move away from absolute monarchies in favor of more democratic and constitutional forms of government.
