## Causes
- **M.A.I.N. Causes:**
  - **Militarism**: arms race, glorification of military power (e.g., naval competition between UK and Germany)
  - **Alliances**: 
    - Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy)
    - Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain)
  - **Imperialism**: competition for colonies (esp. Africa, Asia), increased tensions
  - **Nationalism**: 
    - Ethnic nationalism in Balkans (e.g., Serbs under Austro-Hungarian rule)
    - National pride and rivalry in Europe

- **Immediate Spark:**
  - **June 28, 1914**: Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria assassinated by **Gavrilo Princip**, a Serbian nationalist (Black Hand group)
  - Austria-Hungary issued ultimatum to Serbia → Russia mobilized to defend Serbia → chain reaction of alliances triggered

## Major Events

### Assassination at Sarajevo
- Sparked diplomatic crisis
- Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia
- Germany supported Austria (blank check)
- Russia mobilized → Germany declared war on Russia and France
- **Schlieffen Plan**: German strategy to invade France via Belgium (brought Britain into war)

### Western Front
- **Trench warfare** → stalemate, high casualties, little territorial gain
- Major Battles:
  - **Battle of the Marne** (1914): halted German advance near Paris
  - **Battle of Verdun** (1916): longest battle, French held position
  - **Battle of the Somme** (1916): over 1 million casualties, little gain

### Eastern Front
- Germany and Austria-Hungary vs. Russia
- Larger movement due to vast space
- Russia suffered major defeats (e.g., **Tannenberg**), poorly equipped soldiers
- 1917: **Russian Revolution** → Russia withdrew from war (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk)

### Colonial & Global Fronts
- Battles in Africa and Asia
- Colonized peoples conscripted to fight for European empires
- Japan entered war on Allied side, took German colonies in Pacific
- Ottoman Empire joined Central Powers → fighting in Middle East (e.g., Gallipoli, Arab Revolt)

### US Entry into War
- Initially neutral (1914–1917)
- Factors for joining:
  - **Unrestricted submarine warfare** by Germany (sinking of Lusitania, 1915)
  - **Zimmermann Telegram**: Germany proposed alliance with Mexico against US
- April 1917: US declared war on Germany
- US troops, morale, and supplies helped turn tide

## Effects

### Treaty of Versailles (1919)
- Blamed **Germany** for war (Article 231 "War Guilt Clause")
- Reparations, loss of colonies, military restrictions
- League of Nations formed (Germany and USSR initially excluded)
- Redrew European borders (e.g., Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia created)

### Collapse of Empires
- **German Empire** → became Weimar Republic
- **Austro-Hungarian Empire** → broken up into multiple new states
- **Ottoman Empire** → dismembered; Middle East under British/French mandates
- **Russian Empire** → revolution, civil war, rise of Bolsheviks/USSR

### Social & Economic Impacts
- 10+ million deaths; 20+ million wounded
- Widespread psychological trauma (shell shock)
- Economic devastation in Europe; inflation, debt
- Influenza pandemic (1918–1919): killed 50+ million worldwide

### League of Nations
- First international peacekeeping organization
- Proposed by **Woodrow Wilson’s 14 Points**
- US Senate refused to join; weakened its effectiveness

### New Nations
- Central/Eastern Europe: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, etc.
- Middle East: mandates (Sykes-Picot Agreement) → British control over Iraq, Palestine; French in Syria, Lebanon

### Seeds of WWII
- Harsh treatment of Germany fueled resentment
- Economic troubles and national humiliation helped Nazis rise to power
- Failure of League of Nations to prevent further conflict

## Other Key Points

- **Total War**: economies and societies fully mobilized for war (rationing, propaganda, women in workforce)
- **Technology and Warfare Innovations**:
  - Machine guns, barbed wire, poison gas, tanks, airplanes, submarines
  - Led to mass casualties, new type of industrialized warfare
- **Women’s roles** expanded: factories, nursing, eventually led to suffrage movements gaining ground
- **Colonial Contributions**: soldiers from India, Africa, Southeast Asia fought for imperial powers
- **Russian Revolution (1917)**: Bolsheviks overthrew provisional gov’t, withdrew from war, began communist state
