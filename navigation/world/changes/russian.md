## Russian Revolution (1917)

### Causes
- **Autocratic rule of the Tsars**: Nicholas II's resistance to political reform created unrest.
- **Peasant discontent**: Majority of the population were poor peasants suffering from land hunger and poverty.
- **Industrial worker unrest**: Poor conditions, low wages, and lack of rights in urban factories.
- **Bloody Sunday (1905)**: Massacre of peaceful protesters intensified hatred of the monarchy.
- **Failures of WWI**: Massive military losses, food shortages, and economic collapse worsened public frustration.
- **Weak leadership**: Tsarina Alexandra’s reliance on Rasputin and Tsar Nicholas’s mismanagement discredited the monarchy.
- **Rise of revolutionary ideologies**: Marxist ideas spread through groups like the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.

### Key Events

#### February Revolution (March 1917)
- **Mass protests and strikes in Petrograd**: Triggered by food shortages and war fatigue.
- **Army mutiny**: Soldiers joined the protesters.
- **Tsar Nicholas II abdicated**: Ending centuries of Romanov rule.
- **Provisional Government formed**: Led by Alexander Kerensky, pledged to continue WWI and hold elections.

#### Provisional Government & Dual Power
- **Dual authority**: Soviets (workers’ councils) held power alongside the Provisional Government.
- **Bolsheviks gain popularity**: Promised "Peace, Land, and Bread."
- **Lenin returns**: Issued the April Theses, demanding immediate revolution and Soviet control.

#### October Revolution (November 1917)
- **Bolshevik coup**: Red Guards seized key locations in Petrograd.
- **Winter Palace stormed**: Provisional Government arrested, virtually no resistance.
- **Bolsheviks took control**: Declared a socialist government; Soviets now ruled under Bolshevik leadership.

### Results
- **End of Provisional Government**: Bolsheviks established a one-party communist state.
- **Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918)**: Russia exited WWI, ceding large territory to Germany.
- **Russian Civil War (1917–1922)**: Red Army (Bolsheviks) vs. White Army (monarchists, liberals, foreign forces).
- **Execution of Tsar and family (1918)**: Ended any hope of monarchy restoration.
- **Victory of the Reds**: Bolsheviks consolidated power under Lenin.

### Significance
- **Birth of the Soviet Union (1922)**: First socialist state based on Marxist-Leninist principles.
- **Inspired communist movements**: Worldwide revolutions and leftist uprisings.
- **One-party rule and suppression**: Led to authoritarianism and eventual Stalinist dictatorship.
- **Redistribution of land and nationalization**: Radical economic and social transformation.
