## Latin American Revolutions (1810–1830s)

### Causes
- **Social inequality**: Colonial societies were divided by race and class (peninsulares, creoles, mestizos, indigenous peoples, and enslaved Africans).
- **Enlightenment ideas**: Inspired calls for liberty, equality, popular sovereignty, and independence.
- **American and French Revolutions**: Provided revolutionary models and hope for independence.
- **Napoleon’s invasion of Spain (1808)**: Weakened Spanish authority, sparking revolts across the colonies.
- **Creole discontent**: Wealthy creoles (Spanish descent born in the Americas) were frustrated by exclusion from top government positions.

### Key Events

#### Mexico
- **Miguel Hidalgo (1810)**: Catholic priest who issued the *Grito de Dolores*, rallying mestizos and indigenous people in revolt.
- **José María Morelos**: Continued the struggle after Hidalgo’s execution; fought for land reform and racial equality.
- **Independence (1821)**: Achieved under conservative leadership of **Agustín de Iturbide**, who became emperor (later overthrown, republic declared).

#### South America
- **Simón Bolívar**: "The Liberator" led independence movements in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Advocated republicanism and unity but faced regional divisions.
- **José de San Martín**: Led campaigns in southern South America—Argentina, Chile, and Peru; met with Bolívar in 1822.
- **Gran Colombia**: Bolívar’s failed attempt at a united northern South American republic (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador).

#### Brazil
- **Peaceful independence (1822)**: Prince **Dom Pedro** (son of Portuguese king) declared Brazil’s independence and became Emperor Pedro I.
- **No major war**: Brazil avoided large-scale conflict but retained monarchy and slavery longer than other Latin American states.

### Results
- **End of colonial rule**: Spanish and Portuguese control was broken in most of Latin America.
- **Political instability**: Many new nations faced caudillo rule (military strongmen), civil wars, and weak economies.
- **Limited social change**: Power often remained with elite creoles; slavery and inequality persisted in many areas.
- **Decline of Spain and Portugal**: Marked the collapse of European empires in the Western Hemisphere.

### Significance
- Spread republican ideas and anti-colonial sentiment across Latin America.
- Inspired future reform and liberation movements.
- Altered the global balance of power by reducing European influence in the Americas.
- Set precedent for 19th- and 20th-century nationalist movements worldwide.
