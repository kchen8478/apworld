## French Revolution (1789–1799)

### Causes
- **Social inequality**: Rigid estates system (clergy, nobility, commoners) burdened the Third Estate with taxes.
- **Economic crisis**: National debt from wars (including American Revolution), food shortages, inflation.
- **Weak leadership**: King Louis XVI was indecisive and disconnected from the people.
- **Enlightenment ideas**: Challenged monarchy, promoted liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty.
- **Estates-General deadlock**: Lack of reform led to the formation of the National Assembly by the Third Estate.

### Key Events
- **Storming of the Bastille (1789)**: Symbolic start of the revolution.
- **Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789)**: Asserted natural rights and equality under the law.
- **Women's March on Versailles (1789)**: Forced royal family to Paris; showed power of popular protest.
- **Abolition of monarchy (1792)**: France declared a republic.
- **Execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette (1793)**.
- **Reign of Terror (1793–1794)**: Led by Robespierre; mass executions of "enemies of the revolution."
- **Thermidorian Reaction (1794)**: Robespierre executed; revolution moderated.
- **Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte (1799)**: Seized power in a coup d’état, ending the revolution.

### Results
- **End of feudalism**: Nobility lost privileges; Church lands were nationalized.
- **Inspiration for global revolutions**: Sparked movements in Haiti, Latin America, and beyond.
- **Temporary chaos**: Political instability led to rise of authoritarian rule (Napoleon).
- **Legal reforms**: Ideas of citizenship, secular law, and civil rights took root.

### Significance
- Challenged absolute monarchy and divine right.
- Spread Enlightenment ideals across Europe and the world.
- Influenced future democratic movements and constitutions.
- Set precedent for revolutions driven by popular sovereignty and social justice.
